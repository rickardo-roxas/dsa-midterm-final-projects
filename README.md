This repository contains the major projects developed in the CS 211 Data Structures and Algorithms Class

## Project 1: Infix Conversion and Postfix Evaluation

In this project, we are tasked to take an input infix expression from the user and convert it to its equivalent postfix expression using the Stack data structure. We are also tasked to add a feature in which the program should evaluate the entered postfix expression of the user.

## Project 2: Huffman Coding

For this project, we are tasked to implement the Huffman Coding technique. The user will prompt a phrase/paragraph/sentence and the program should generate a huffman table that includes the characters and their corresponding binary code. We are also tasked to add features such as plain text to huffman code conversion, and vice versa.

## Project 3: Graph Theory

This project illustrates the Graph data structure. The user will be prompted to import an adjacency matrix, and the program can traverse it using the breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms. It can also find the shortest path from each vertices using the Dijkstra algorithm.
